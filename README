PhyloSift

PhyloSift is a suite of software tools to conduct phylogenetic
analysis of genomes and metagenomes.

Using a reference database of protein sequences, PhyloSift can scan
new sequences against that database for homologs and identify the
phylogenetic relationship of the new sequence to the database
sequences. During this procedure, high quality alignments of codon and
amino acid sequence are generated.

Our google group is a place to ask questions, request functionalities, 
get help if you're stuck, and generally interact with our development 
team at UC Davis.

If you run into a bug during your analysis, please post this as
an "Issue" in GitHub. These tasks get priority, and we'll fix any 
broken pipes as soon a possible!

== Quick Start for the Impatient ==

Download PhyloSift from here:
http://edhar.genomecenter.ucdavis.edu/~koadman/phylosift/phylosift_latest.tar.bz2

Unpack with `tar xvjf phylosift_latest.tar.bz2`, then change into the new directory and run:

`bin/phylosift all --output=results sequences.fasta`

Or using compressed paired FastQ data from an Illumina instrument:

`bin/phylosift all --output=results --paired read_1.gz read_2.gz`

Results will be stored in a new directory called "results".

See `results/krona.html` for a visual summary of the sequence data.


== NEW VERSION ==

PhyloSift has several new features :

* The marker gene database has been expanded to encompass Bacteria,
  Archaea, Eukarya, and virii.
* Support for processing of next-gen sequence data including Illumina,
  454, and others
* Integration with metAMOS for pre-assembling next-generation datasets
* Codon based alignment of marker genes

...more to come!

== Installation ==

The easy way :

Download the tarball archive from

   http://edhar.genomecenter.ucdavis.edu/~koadman/phylosift/phylosift_latest.tar.bz2

Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the software and run :

   tar -xvf phylosift_latest.tar.bz2

PhyloSift is ready for use. Refer to the Usage section.

The hard way (installing from the development repository) :

Download and install Git for your system. 

   http://git-scm.com/

For debian/ubuntu systems, run the following command

   sudo apt-get install git

To check out the PhyloSift development repository, run the following
command :

   git clone git://github.com/gjospin/PhyloSift.git

It may also be necessary to install several support packages,
including BioPerl, Bio::Phylo, and others.

== Updating PhyloSift ==

If running PhyloSift from a packaged release (i.e., you chose the
"easy way"), simply download the newest tarball.

If running PhyloSift from the development repository, run the
following command :

   git update

== Usage ==

$ phylosift <Mode> <options> <sequence_file>

   sequence_file needs to be in fasta format

$ phylosift <Mode> <options> -paired <sequence_file_1> <sequence_file_2>

   sequence_file_1 and _2 must contain paired sequences


Creating a PhyloSift Marker (Does not allow for taxonomic summaries,
only searching, aligning and placement steps) :

$ phylosift build_marker <alignment_file> <PD pruning threshold>

Example 1:  $ phylosift build_marker test.aln 0.01

Example 2:  $ phylosift build_marker -f test.aln 0.01

WARNING : This step does not automatically add the new marker to the
search indices. You will need to rerun the indexing step.

The marker directory will be added directly to the directory in which
PhyloSift looks for markers when running.

If a marker with the same name exists, the marker building process
will be halted unless the -f option is used.

The marker name will be the same as the alignment given minus the
trailing suffix. If the user wants to build a marker from the file
<test.aln>, the marker name will be <test>


== Index the search databases ==

This step is run automatically when markers are downloaded but if you
add new markers, you will need to run this step manually.

   $ phylosift index


== Modes ==

Mode : Only execute a specific step in the pipeline

  all          : execute all the following steps in that order
  search       : only execute the database searches + write candidate 
                 files
  align        : hmmsearch + hmmalign + trims + coverage filters
  placer       : run pplacer on the results from the align step
  summary      : run the taxonomy assignment steps
  index        : indexes the various databases needed for Rapsearch, 
                 Bowtie and Blast
  build_marker : creates a reference package from a multiple alignment
                 file
  sim          : Generates simulated reads using Grinder from a set of genomes, top PD contribution and randomly picked
                 from the concatenated tree for the marker DB
                 Need to have the genomes downloaded to a directory. This feature should be reserved for in house usage.
                 Generates paired ends reads in fastq format, 454 reads in fasta format and paired end reads in fasta format.
                 Generates 2 files containing the taxon IDs for the genomes used in the simulations
                 
== Options ==

Options Available at this time : 

   -h -help             Prints the usage section of the README

   -custom <file>       Reads a custom marker list from a file 
                        otherwise use all the markers from the 
                        markers directory

   --threaded=<Number>  Runs Blast and Hmmer using the number of
                        processors sepcified Runs 1 Pplacer per
                        processor specified
		                  (DEFAULT : 1)

   --clean              Cleans the temporary files created by 
                        Phylosift (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)

   --paired             Looks for 2 input files (paired end 
                        sequencing) in FastQ format.  Reversing 
                        the sequences for the second file listed 
                        and appending to the corresponding pair 
                        from the first file listed.

   --continue           Enables the pipeline to continue to 
                        subsequent steps when not using the 'all' 
                        mode

   --reverse		      If the submitted sequences were Nucleotides, 
                        the program prints out an alignment for all 
                        the markers in DNA space in addition to the 
                        one in Protein space.

   --isolate            Use this mode if you are running data from 
                        an Isolate genome

   --updated            Use the set of updated markers with newly
                        sequenced genomes instead of the stock 
                        markers
                       
   --output=<directory> Specifies an output directory instead of using
                        PS's default

== Requirements ==

A 64bit operating system is required as the binaries packaged with the
PhyloSift scripts were compiled using such OS. PhyloSift will NOT work
on a 32bit operating system. PhyloSift depends on a great many other
open source software packages. The precompiled version linked above
bundles most of the dependencies into a single downloadable package.
